 - 1. Slight overhaul of Upgrades.js
  - I added more beginning shoot upgrades so it doesn't
  - take as long to get up and running with a Build & Dealer.
 - 2. Added more upgrades for Weed, Meth and Cocaine. 
  - Should help with end-game players who are just waiting for
  the factory.
 - 3. Balanced the Upgrades.js multipliers, should be much more even and less
 long waits between upgrades. I also tried to make Guns less powerful while adding
 more features and upgrades for the drugs. This way your primary source of income
 isn't a gun. 
 - 4. Modified Builds and Dealers for more balanced early game
