<h1><a href="http://totominc.github.io/incremental-rpg/">Incremental-RPG</a></h1>
Incremental-RPG is a simple incremental-game where you have to kill monsters to gain XP, gold and diamonds. You have basic things like a shop to buy better stuff, an inventory to equip/unequip items. There is also a save system, so don't worry you will not lose anything!
Incremental-RPG is in prototype stage, so it may be buggy in certain points.
The game design is inspired by Google Material Design, and is built especially with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/"></a> and <a href="https://bootswatch.com/paper/"></a>. I also included <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
