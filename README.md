<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/incremental-rpg/"><u>Incremental-RPG</u></a></h3>
Incremental-RPG is a simple incremental-game where you have to kill monsters to gain XP, gold and diamonds. You have basic things like a shop to buy better stuff, an inventory to equip/unequip items. There is also a save system, so don't worry you will not lose anything!<br>
Incremental-RPG is in his prototype stage, so it may be buggy in certain points (like in inventory).<br>
This game is constantly being updated, so take a look to the game regulary!

<h5>What included in the game :</h5>
- <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>
- <a href="https://bootswatch.com/paper/">Paper theme from Bootswatch</a>

<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/blackmarket"><u>Blackmarket</u></a></h3>
Another simple incremental-game, about selling drugs. You start with only a gun, and you have to build a drug empire to become trillionnaire. Design is also ugly compared to <a href="http://totominc.github.io/incremental-rpg/">Incremental-RPG</a>, but Blackmarket was my first really big project about in HTML/CSS/JS.<br>
I don't update anymore the game, maybe one day I will return back of the development of Blackmarket.

<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/moneylife"><u>Money-Life</u></a></h3>
Money-Life is a simple <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/hyperhippogames/adventure-capitalist">Adventure Capitalist</a> clone, which was made to help me to learn Javascript. This game is pretty old and ugly.
