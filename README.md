<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/incremental-rpg/">Incremental-RPG</a></h3>
Incremental-RPG is a simple incremental-game where you have to kill monsters to gain XP, gold and diamonds. You have basic things like a shop to buy better stuff, an inventory to equip/unequip items. There is also a save system, so don't worry you will not lose anything!<br>
Incremental-RPG is in his prototype stage, so it may be buggy in certain points.
The game design is inspired by Google Material Design, and is built especially with <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> and <a href="https://bootswatch.com/paper/">Paper theme from Bootswatch</a>. I also included <a href="http://jquery.com/">jQuery</a>.
