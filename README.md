<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/blackmarket"><u>Blackmarket</u></a></h3>
Another simple incremental-game, about selling drugs. You start with only a gun, and you have to build a drug empire to become trillionnaire. Blackmarket was my first really big project about in HTML/CSS/JS. It has been totally re-done : scripts and interface. Blackmarket has reach its official release, take a look now!

<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/universe-god"><u>Universe-God</u></a></h3>
This is my new project, actually in his prototype stage. You are the god and have to rebuild the universe. Of course, it's an another incremental-game!

<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/idle-quester"><u>Idle-Quester</u></a></h3>
Idle-RPG is the web-version of the original game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topcog.idlequest.android&hl=fr">Idle-Quest</a> on Android. It's just a simple web-remake, and I use my own formulas on this game. It's a simple project to help me learn more.

<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/incremental-rpg">Incremental-RPG</a></h3>
A simple incremental-game with a touch of RPG on it. It was just to help me learn more (again!), and it's now currently not updated anymore.

<h3><a href="http://totominc.github.io/moneylife/old/"><u>Money-Life</u></a></h3>
Money-Life is a simple <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/hyperhippogames/adventure-capitalist">Adventure Capitalist</a> clone, which was made to help me to learn Javascript. This game is pretty old and ugly.
