# [totominc.io - homepage](https://totominc.io/)

This is an old repository that I manage only when I have some time. You will find all my old projects, that I made when I was learning programming, especially web tehcnologies. Don't take any sample code of this repo as a good example, they are of very poor quality.

### [Blackmarket - incremental-game](http://totominc.github.io/blackmarket)
Another simple incremental-game, about selling drugs. You start with only a gun, and you have to build a drug empire to become trillionnaire. Blackmarket was my first really big project about in HTML/CSS/JS. It has been totally re-done : scripts and interface. Blackmarket has reach its official release, take a look now!

### [Incremental-RPG](http://totominc.github.io/incremental-rpg)
My very second project in JS, where I wanted to focus more on design using Bootstrap and some free themes.

### [Idle-Quester](http://totominc.github.io/idle-quester)
Idle-Quester is a web version of the original app/game [Idle-Quest](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topcog.idlequest.android) for Android. This was only made in few hours, so maybe you can expect it be 'slightly' buggy.

### [inc-game-rreader](http://totominc.github.io/inc-games-rreader)
I wanted to make a fun and small project to use an API, and since /r/incremental_games is my favourite subreddit, I made an alternative website to browse it, and looks pretty nice!

### [Money-Life (old)](http://totominc.github.io/moneylife/old/)
My very first small project to learn JS, it's just an [Adventure Capitalist](http://www.kongregate.com/games/hyperhippogames/adventure-capitalist) clone.

### [Universe-God](http://totominc.github.io/universe-god)
Another prototype were you rebuild the universe with your god's hands. Will stay as a prototype for ever.
