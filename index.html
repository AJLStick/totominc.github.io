  <p>This is an old repository that I manage only when I have some time. You will find all my old projects, that I made when I was learning programming, especially web tehcnologies. Don&#39;t take any sample code of this repo as a good example, they are of very poor quality.</p>
  <h3 id="-blackmarket-incremental-game-http-archive-totominc-io-blackmarket-"><a href="http://archive.totominc.io/blackmarket">Blackmarket - incremental-game</a></h3>
  <p>Another simple incremental-game, about selling drugs. You start with only a gun, and you have to build a drug empire to become trillionnaire. Blackmarket was my first really big project about in HTML/CSS/JS. It has been totally re-done: scripts and interface. Blackmarket has reach its official release, take a look now!</p>
  <h3 id="-incremental-rpg-http-archive-totominc-io-incremental-rpg-"><a href="http://archive.totominc.io/incremental-rpg">Incremental-RPG</a></h3>
  <p>My very second project in JS, where I wanted to focus more on design using Bootstrap and some free themes.</p>
  <h3 id="-idle-quester-http-archive-totominc-io-idle-quester-"><a href="http://archive.totominc.io/idle-quester">Idle-Quester</a></h3>
  <p>Idle-Quester is a web version of the original app/game <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.topcog.idlequest.android">Idle-Quest</a> for Android. This was only made in few hours, so maybe you can expect it be &#39;slightly&#39; buggy.</p>
  <h3 id="-inc-game-rreader-http-archive-totominc-io-inc-games-rreader-"><a href="http://archive.totominc.io/inc-games-rreader">inc-game-rreader</a></h3>
  <p>I wanted to make a fun and small project to use an API, and since /r/incremental_games is my favourite subreddit, I made an alternative website to browse it, and looks pretty nice!</p>
  <h3 id="-money-life-old-http-archive-totominc-io-moneylife-old-"><a href="http://archive.totominc.io/moneylife/old/">Money-Life (old)</a></h3>
  <p>My very first small project to learn JS, it&#39;s just an <a href="http://www.kongregate.com/games/hyperhippogames/adventure-capitalist">Adventure Capitalist</a> clone.</p>
  <h3 id="-universe-god-http-archive-totominc-io-universe-god-"><a href="http://archive.totominc.io/universe-god">Universe-God</a></h3>
  <p>Another prototype were you rebuild the universe with your god&#39;s hands. Will stay as a prototype for ever.</p>
